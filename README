• A robot drawing arm using Arduino UNO.
• Captures an image and performs image processing techniques using MATLAB
• Works on 20cm x 20cm plane to make line drawings.
• Uses a pre-defined trigonometric formula to convert positional values to angular
values which are then fed to servo motors
• Uses a smart depth first search algorithm to connect all the points.
